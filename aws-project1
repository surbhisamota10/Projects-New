**Building a 3-tier web application architecture with AWS**

https://github.com/surbhisamota10/Projects-New/blob/main/3-tier%20web%20application%20architecture.jfif

Here’s a simplified description:

Pre-requisites:
-> AWS account
-> Basic knowledge of AWS services like EC2, RDS, and VPC, Auto scaling groups,Load balancer, and security groups.
-> Familiarity with Linux commands, scripting, and SSH.
-> Familiarity with Linux commands, basic scripting, and SSH.
-> Access to a command line tool.

Step 1: Login in your aws account .

Step 2: Set Up Your VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

This base network consists of:

A VPC.
Two (2) public subnets spread across two availability zones (Web Tier).
Two (2) private subnets spread across two availability zones (Application Tier).
Two (2) private subnets spread across two availability zones (Database Tier).
One (1) public route table that connects the public subnets to an internet gateway.
One (1) private route table that will connect the Application Tier private subnets and a NAT gateway.

In the VPC console, let’s create a new VPC. We’ll select the 'VPC and more' option and name our project 'MyVPC_web_app' with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16

Now you need to go inside subnet section ,
we need to make sure we 'Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address' for BOTH public subnets so we can access its resources via the Internet.
